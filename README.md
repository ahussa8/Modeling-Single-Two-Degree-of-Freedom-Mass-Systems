# ME 351: Modeling & Analysis of Dynamic Systems

This project focuses on the analysis of second-order mechanical systems using both analytical and simulation-based approaches in MATLAB and Simulink.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- Investigated four damping conditions (undamped, underdamped, critically damped, overdamped) for a mass-spring-damper system using MATLAB.
- Developed plots of time-domain displacement responses using differential equation solutions.
- Modeled a two-degree-of-freedom system in Simulink and Simscape with unit step excitation and analyzed displacement responses of both masses under different parameter values.

## ðŸ§ª Tools Used

- MATLAB
- Simulink
- Simscape

## ðŸ“ˆ Features

- Numerical analysis of second-order ODEs with varying damping coefficients.
- Time-domain simulations and visualizations of dynamic system behavior.
- Interactive modeling of coupled mass-spring systems with external forcing.
