# Modeling-Single-Two-Degree-of-Freedom-Mass-Systems
Analyzed underdamped, critically damped, overdamped, and undamped second-order systems using MATLAB. Simulated a two-degree-of-freedom mass-spring-damper system using Simulink and Simscape, visualizing dynamic responses under varying damping and external forces.
